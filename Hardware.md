Known good and bad configurations of hardware

# Introduction #

The typical setup is a Raspberry Pi with a USB to RS485/422 industrial serial port. RS422 is the port standard on Eversolar inverters, but RS485 ports can also communicate with the inverters when they are wired for half duplex.

Cabling can be done through cutting open a network cable and rewire according to the manual - or use a network crimper tool for a sturdy, nice looking solution

Here's an example of how to connect an RS422 adapter
|Eversolar pin|colour|Eversolar signal|Description|
|:------------|:-----|:---------------|:----------|
|1            |yellow|RXD+            |Yellow RXD+ Input Data + (B) Input|
|2            |white |RXD-            |White RXD- Input Data – (A) Input|
|3            |orange|TXD+            |Orange TXD+ Output Data + (B) Output|
|4            |black |gnd             |Black GND GND Device ground supply pin|
|6            |red   |TXD-            |Red TXD- Output Data – (A) Output|


You can interconnect additional Eversolar inverters with regular RJ45 network patch cables

Here's an example of how to connect an RS485 adapter
|Eversolar pin|Eversolar signal|RS485|
|:------------|:---------------|:----|
|1            |RXD+            |Data + |
|2            |RXD-            |Data – |
|3            |TXD+            |Data +|
|4            |gnd             | GND |
|6            |TXD-            |Data – |

And another example
|Eversolar Pin|Colour|Name|RS 485 Pin|Colour|Name|
|:------------|:-----|:---|:---------|:-----|:---|
|1            |Orange/white|TX\_A|3         |Green/white|RX\_A|
|2            |Orange|TX\_B|6         |Green |RX\_B|
|3            |Green/white|RX\_A|1         |Orange/white|TX\_A|
|4            |Blue  |GND |7         |Brown/white|GND |
|5            |Blue/white|GND |8         |Brown |GND |
|6            |Green |RX\_B|2         |Orange|TX\_B|
|7            |NC    | |4   |NC        | |
|8            |NC    | |5   |NC        | |


### inverted polarity ###
A few users have accidentally switched plus and minus on their cabling, strangely, the Eversolar inverters reply, but unsuccessfull:

Sending: aa 55 01 00 00 00 10 00 00 01 10
received packet from inverter:
**95 55 ff ff ff** df f7 ff fd d7 00 95 55 ff ff ff df
ff ff fd df 00

The ff ff ff ff indicates the inverted polarity, they should be 00 00 00 00
## Termination ##
There is debate on the necessity of termination, it appears not to be required with cable lengths under 10 meters
## Known good computers ##
Raspberry Pi version B. Versions A, A+, B+ and 2 should work fine. Regular PC's are also used
